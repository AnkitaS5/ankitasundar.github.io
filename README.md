### Hello! I am a sophomore studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I am also pursuing a certificate in Entrepreneurship & Technology. Last summer, I was a software engineer intern at Taltrics, a Berkeley-based startup that is focused on AI-driven resourcement management tools. I am interested in learning more about the world of software and AI.
