### Hello! I am a sophomore studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I am also pursuing a certificate in Entrepreneurship & Technology. Last summer, I interned as a software engineer at Taltrics, a startup that is focused on AI-driven resourcement management tools. I am interested in learning more about the world of software and AI.
